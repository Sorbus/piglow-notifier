# piglow-notifier
Provides a visual indicator when various things happen.

Dependencies:
  - PRAW (https://praw.readthedocs.org/)
  - PyGlow (https://github.com/benleb/PyGlow) (for python 2.7; 2to3 translates it acceptably)
 
There are various other dependencies required to get those working and to set up a Raspberry Pi to talk to i2c devices; explaining them is outside the scope of this document at this time.
